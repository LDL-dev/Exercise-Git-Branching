### INGREDIENTS
 
* 200 g carrot
* 100 g pak choi
* 20 g ginger
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 red onions

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Firstly letâ€™s prepare our veg, finely slice the carrot and the pak choi, peel and finely slice the ginger. Leave the garlic whole.
2. Weigh the veg, which comes to approx 450g. Multiply the amount by .02 or 2%, which gives you 9g, which is the amount of salt required. Gather your 9g of salt.
3. Get a clean jar to ferment in with a matching lid.
4. Add the prepared veg along with the salt and cover with drinking water. Ensure all veg is submerged under the water. Ensure to date your ferment so you remember when it was started. Close the lid not too tight so that gases can escape but also tight enough to stop bacteria entering.
5. Leave to ferment on your kitchen counter outside of direct sunlight.
6. Taste every couple of days until it reaches your desired level of acidity and the veg is broken down enough. Enjoy!
